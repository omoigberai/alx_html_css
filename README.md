## Task 0: Some Early Styling

For this task, I set up the initial CSS structure of the project.

### Steps I followed:
1. Created a new directory called css_basic inside my repository alx_html_css.
2. Copied the index.html and tweets.html files from the html_basic directory of the previous project into the new css_basic directory.
3. Created two CSS files:
   - base.css → contains the base styling rules.
   - styles.css → an empty stylesheet for my custom rules.
4. Updated both HTML files (index.html and tweets.html) by adding the following lines inside the <head> tag:

   ```html
   <link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet">
   <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
