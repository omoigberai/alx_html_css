## ⚙ Design and Font Notes  

- Fonts used in the design:  
  - *Source Sans Pro*  
  - *Spin Cycle OT*  

If these fonts are not installed on your system, you can:  
- Download *Source Sans Pro* from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro).  
- Obtain *Spin Cycle OT* from the project resources or Figma file.

Some size values in the Figma design may appear as floats (e.g., 123.45px).  
➡ Feel free to round them to the nearest pixel value for cleaner CSS.

## Task 0: Some Early Styling

For this task, I set up the initial CSS structure of the project.

### Steps I followed:
1. Created a new directory called css_basic inside my repository alx_html_css.
2. Copied the index.html and tweets.html files from the html_basic directory of the previous project into the new css_basic directory.
3. Created two CSS files:
   - base.css → contains the base styling rules.
   - styles.css → an empty stylesheet for my custom rules.
4. Updated both HTML files (index.html and tweets.html) by adding the following lines inside the <head> tag:

   ```html
   <link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet">
   <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
>>>>>>> origin/main
